/**
 * Transport to the object store.
 *
 * requestUrl is the only Obsidian networking API that bypasses CORS (desktop
 * routes through Electron's net module, mobile through a Capacitor bridge).
 * On modern Obsidian no bucket CORS configuration is needed at all. Older
 * builds required allowing app://obsidian.md, capacitor://localhost and
 * http://localhost with ETag in exposed headers; the minAppVersion floor
 * removes that.
 *
 * TWO AUTH MODES, and the first is strongly preferred:
 *
 *  1. NETWORK-LAYER (recommended). Expose the bucket read-only behind Tailscale
 *     or an auth proxy and hold NO credentials in the plugin at all. Consumers
 *     are read-only in phase 1, so there is nothing to sign, no SigV4 library,
 *     and no secret sitting in a file that travels with the vault.
 *
 *  2. DIRECT S3 with aws4fetch (~3 KB gzipped, versus 500 KB+ for
 *     @aws-sdk/client-s3). Use AwsV4Signer to compute headers, then hand them
 *     to requestUrl. Use a READ-ONLY Garage key so a leak costs course slides
 *     rather than the bucket.
 *
 *     RISK TO VERIFY EARLY: aws4fetch signs via SubtleCrypto, which needs a
 *     secure context. Obsidian mobile's origin scheme makes that unreliable.
 *     Test on a real phone before committing to this path.
