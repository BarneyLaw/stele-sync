# garage-obsync

A 3-node Garage cluster in the `obsync` namespace, serving as the S3 store for
stele-pull phase 1. Independent of the Garage on nebula that backs CNPG/etcd
backups — separate cluster, separate RPC secret, separate failure domain.

The manifests get you running pods. Forming the cluster takes the steps below,
in order; only steps 1 and 5 end in a commit.

From Git Bash on Windows, run `export MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1` first. Otherwise
Git Bash rewrites `/garage` in `kubectl exec ... -- /garage` into
`C:/Program Files/Git/garage` and every exec fails with `no such file or
directory`.

## 0. Prerequisite: Longhorn drain policy

Garage's volumes use `longhorn-garage` (`storageclass.yaml`): one Longhorn
replica per volume, kept on the pod's own node, because Garage already stores
three copies itself. Longhorn's default `node-drain-policy`,
`block-if-contains-last-replica`, refuses to drain a node holding the only
replica of any volume, which is every Garage node. kured would time out the
drain after 20 minutes, release its lock, and retry forever.

Set it to `allow-if-replica-is-stopped`: the drain waits until the Garage pod
has been evicted and its volume detached, then proceeds. Volumes with three
replicas are unaffected. Commit this as a file in `apps/longhorn-extras/`
(`values-longhorn.yaml` deliberately sets no Longhorn settings):

```yaml
apiVersion: longhorn.io/v1beta2
kind: Setting
metadata:
  name: node-drain-policy
  namespace: longhorn-system
value: "allow-if-replica-is-stopped"
```

```bash
kubectl -n longhorn-system get settings.longhorn.io node-drain-policy -o jsonpath='{.value}'
```

## 1. Seal the secrets (before the first sync)

`kustomization.yaml` references `sealed-secret.yaml`, which is not committed
until you generate it. Until then `kustomize build` fails and the Application
shows `Unknown` — that is the intended failure mode.

```bash
# rpc-secret must be exactly 32 bytes, hex-encoded (64 chars). Garage refuses
# anything else at startup.
kubectl create secret generic garage-secrets \
  --namespace obsync \
  --from-literal=rpc-secret="$(openssl rand -hex 32)" \
  --from-literal=admin-token="$(openssl rand -base64 32)" \
  --dry-run=client -o yaml \
| kubeseal --cert sealed-secrets.pem --format yaml \
  > apps/garage-obsync/sealed-secret.yaml

git add apps/garage-obsync/sealed-secret.yaml && git commit && git push
```

SealedSecrets are encrypted to namespace+name. `obsync` / `garage-secrets` must
match exactly or decryption fails silently at the controller.

## 2. Apply the Application

```bash
kubectl apply -f argocd/garage-obsync.yaml
kubectl -n obsync get pods -w
```

Expect three pods `Running` but `0/1 Ready`. That is correct at this point:
readiness is `/health`, and `/health` is 503 until a layout exists.

Check that every volume's single replica landed on its own pod's node. If one
did not, the pod sits in `ContainerCreating`, because `strict-local` only lets
a volume attach where its replica is:

```bash
kubectl -n obsync get pods -o custom-columns=POD:.metadata.name,NODE:.spec.nodeName
kubectl -n longhorn-system get volumes.longhorn.io \
  -o custom-columns=PVC:.status.kubernetesStatus.pvcName,NODE:.status.currentNodeID,REPLICAS:.spec.numberOfReplicas \
  | grep -E 'PVC|garage'
```

## 3. Connect the nodes (one time)

Nothing discovers peers here: each pod starts knowing only itself, and
`garage status` on garage-0 lists a single node. Connect them by hand so the
layout can be assigned. Step 5 makes the connection permanent.

```bash
for i in 0 1 2; do
  echo "garage-$i $(kubectl -n obsync exec garage-$i -- /garage node id -q)"
done

kubectl -n obsync exec garage-0 -- /garage node connect \
  <id-1>@garage-1.garage-rpc.obsync.svc.cluster.local:3901
kubectl -n obsync exec garage-0 -- /garage node connect \
  <id-2>@garage-2.garage-rpc.obsync.svc.cluster.local:3901

kubectl -n obsync exec garage-0 -- /garage status   # HEALTHY NODES lists all three
```

Keep the three IDs for step 5.

## 4. Assign the cluster layout (one time, per node)

Garage's layout is cluster metadata, not Kubernetes state. ArgoCD has no
visibility into it and cannot recreate it.

```bash
kubectl -n obsync get pods -o wide   # which node each garage-N landed on

# One zone per node, named after the node the pod runs on: Garage places the 3
# replicas in distinct zones. Capacity a little under the 75Gi data volume,
# which Longhorn enforces: 70G leaves room for the filesystem and Garage itself.
kubectl -n obsync exec garage-0 -- /garage layout assign -z <node-of-garage-0> -c 70G <id-0>
kubectl -n obsync exec garage-0 -- /garage layout assign -z <node-of-garage-1> -c 70G <id-1>
kubectl -n obsync exec garage-0 -- /garage layout assign -z <node-of-garage-2> -c 70G <id-2>

kubectl -n obsync exec garage-0 -- /garage layout show
kubectl -n obsync exec garage-0 -- /garage layout apply --version 1
```

Within a poll cycle all three pods go `1/1 Ready`, and `garage status` shows
each node with its zone and capacity.

## 5. Commit the peers (do not skip)

The connections from step 3 live only in each node's peer cache, which stores
pod IPs. Every pod restart changes its IP. In a rolling update the last pod to
restart comes back knowing only the other two's OLD addresses. They have moved,
and they only know its old address too. That pod stays `0/1 Ready`, with
`Could not reach quorum` and `connect to 10.42.x.y:3901 timed out` in its logs.
Any change to `garage.toml` causes such a rollout, even one that only converts
the line endings.

Uncomment `bootstrap_peers` in `garage.toml`, fill in the three full IDs from
step 3, and commit. Peers are then found by DNS name on every start. Keep the
file's line endings LF: an editor that saves it as CRLF produces a new
ConfigMap hash and a rollout that changes nothing.

```bash
git add apps/garage-obsync/garage.toml && git commit && git push
```

The config hash changes, so Argo CD rolls the pods one at a time. This step has
to come after the layout: a rolling update waits for each pod to be Ready, and
before step 4 none can be.

## 6. Bucket and access key for obsync

```bash
kubectl -n obsync exec garage-0 -- /garage bucket create obsync
kubectl -n obsync exec garage-0 -- /garage key create obsync-app
kubectl -n obsync exec garage-0 -- /garage bucket allow --read --write obsync --key obsync-app
```

The worker's SealedSecret takes this key: see `apps/obsync-worker/README.md`
step 1. `garage key info obsync-app --show-secret` prints both halves. Client
config:

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Endpoint | `http://garage.obsync.svc.cluster.local:3900` |
| Region | `garage` |
| Addressing | **path-style** (`UsePathStyle: true`) |
| TLS | none — in-cluster only |

Path-style is not optional: vhost-style needs `<bucket>.s3.garage.internal` to
resolve, and nothing serves that zone.

## 7. Obsidian access

The plugin reads the store at `https://obsync.lab.packetcraft.dev`. The route,
`ingressroute.yaml`, goes through Traefik to Garage's web endpoint. That
endpoint takes unsigned GETs and answers Range requests, so the plugin needs
no credentials. Only `manifests/` and `blobs/` are routed. Three one-time steps:

```bash
# Garage chooses the bucket by Host header: allow website reads and give the
# bucket an alias equal to the hostname.
kubectl -n obsync exec garage-0 -- /garage bucket website --allow obsync
kubectl -n obsync exec garage-0 -- /garage bucket alias obsync obsync.lab.packetcraft.dev
```

DNS is not managed by this repo. In Cloudflare, zone `packetcraft.dev`:

| Type | Name | Content | Proxy |
|---|---|---|---|
| A | `obsync.lab` | `192.168.1.242` | DNS only |

`192.168.1.242` is Traefik's ingress VIP, the address every `*.lab` record
points at. It is private, so the name only works on the LAN or the tailnet.

Check from a machine on the tailnet:

```bash
curl -s https://obsync.lab.packetcraft.dev/manifests/<course-id>/latest   # a run id
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' https://obsync.lab.packetcraft.dev/runs/   # 404
```

Then, in Obsidian, **obsync → Setup**: Store URL
`https://obsync.lab.packetcraft.dev`, Bucket empty.

A 404 on `latest` for a course the worker has pulled means the alias or the
website flag is missing: `garage bucket info obsync` should show
`Website access: true` and both global aliases.

## Operational notes

- **Quorum is 2 of 3.** kured's `concurrency: 1` already guarantees one node at
  a time, which this survives. Two nodes down means reads and writes fail.
- **strict-local pins pods to nodes.** Each data volume's only replica lives on
  the node its pod first ran on, and it can attach nowhere else, so that pod
  never moves: it waits out a reboot. Losing a node means losing that replica
  until the node returns. Garage rebuilds from the other two; Longhorn does not
  migrate anything.
- **Growing `data`**: patch each PVC, and Longhorn expands it online.
  `kubectl -n obsync patch pvc data-garage-0 -p '{"spec":{"resources":{"requests":{"storage":"100Gi"}}}}'`
  (repeat for 1 and 2), then raise each node's `garage layout assign -c`. The
  template size in `statefulset.yaml` only matters for PVCs created later;
  applying a change there needs
  `kubectl delete statefulset garage -n obsync --cascade=orphan` and a re-sync.
- **No Longhorn backups for these volumes.** The store is a cache Canvas can
  refill, and three 75Gi volumes over NFS is a lot of backup for no recovery
  value. Do not add them to a recurring backup job.
- **A node stuck `0/1 Ready` after a rollout**, listed under FAILED NODES by the
  other two, has lost track of its peers' addresses (step 5). Reconnect it by
  DNS name from the stuck pod; the others learn its new address in return:
  `kubectl -n obsync exec garage-N -- /garage node connect <id>@garage-M.garage-rpc.obsync.svc.cluster.local:3901`
  for each other node M. Then check that `bootstrap_peers` is really set.
- **Config edits roll the pods.** `garage.toml` is a `configMapGenerator`, so a
  commit produces a new ConfigMap name and a rolling restart. That is deliberate
  (subPath mounts never pick up in-place ConfigMap changes).
- **Only reads leave the cluster.** The IngressRoute exposes the web endpoint's
  `manifests/` and `blobs/` on `*.lab`, which means the LAN and the tailnet, never
  the public tunnel. The S3 API (writes, signed) and admin stay
  cluster-internal. Read access is unauthenticated: anyone on the tailnet can
  fetch course files.
- **No NetworkPolicy yet.** Worth adding once the obsync backend exists, so only
  it can reach port 3900 and nothing can reach 3903.
